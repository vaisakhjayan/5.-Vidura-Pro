so here we are again, Megan Markle in the headlines, not for a royal drama or
some Netflix revelation, But Because her latest venture is imploding in slow
motion. and honestly, it's not even shocking at this point. the brand she's been
hyping, American Riviera, Orchard turned As ever, turned who knows what is
spiraling into what can only be described As lifestyle branding chaos. If you're
wondering what this brand is about, join the club, no one knows. not even the
people she's supposedly hired to help run it. Because Apparently, no one's
actually running anything. Let's rewind for a second. Megan's been teasing this
brand for months, maybe even years, on Instagram. Carefully filtered photos,
poetic captions, food puns that land awkwardly, and vague quotes about wellness
or self-love. and it came time to actually drop a product. it was like watching
someone fumble a handoff in slow motion. there was no build-up, no vision, no
consistency. she launched a handful of items, jam, hibiscus tea, some sort of
country sheet gift set, and then silence, like literal radio silence, no
follow-up, no tutorials, no engagement, just more curated snapshots and cryptic
updates like restocking soon. what are we restocking, Megan? is As ever anyway.
is it food? is it fashion? is it a hospitality brand? Because the only clear
thing is that it's not clear at all. one day she's supposedly doing rosé wine,
then it's a hotel line. then some weird luxury pantry goods that seem like They
were plucked From a gift basket at a Hampton in. It's like she threw everything
into a mood board, closed her eyes, and let Netflix fund whatever stuck. and
yes, Netflix is bankrolling the circus. That's probably the biggest revelation
here. According to Insiders, Megan doesn't have a team. not a marketing squad,
not a development Crew, nothing. It's just her picking out pre-approved samples
that Netflix sends over, slapping a bird-themed label on it, and calling it a
luxury lifestyle line. It's the Flamingo Estate logo just with hummingbirds now.
That's not vision. That's rebranding someone else's leftovers. even the rollout
was a hot mess. Insiders say she wanted everything to Sell out instantly to
create the solution of high demand. you know, the old scarcity trick, But it
backfired. either the batch was so small that no one noticed, or she tried to
spend mediocre demand into hype by pretending things were out of stock. But If
you're not following up with content, customer engagement, or even showing your
product in use, what's the point? people can't get excited over a product They
don't understand. you can't just post a picture of yourself running into the
ocean and expect folks to to spend $28.0 on raspberry spread. this kind of
chaotic execution wouldn't fly with any other founder. But somehow, Megan
thought she could leapfrog years of brand building and land at the top of the
lifestyle space by just existing. Meanwhile, brands like Goop started As
newsletters. years of building trust, taste, and voice. Wheneth Paltrow didn't
just toss bath salts online and disappear, she hustled. Megan? She's acting like
a monocedo goddess who believes her name alone is enough. But news flash.
selling J-Crew sweaters on Instagram doesn't mean people want to buy your
mystery jam. now, the left-leaning Hollywood media that used to defend her,
they're starting to roast her. Puck just ran a brutal piece calling the brand a
joke. when even your own ideological allies turn on you, it's bad, real bad.
especially when They start calling you the real Housewife of Montecito behind
your back. and let's not forget the real kicker. Megan reportedly passed on
investing in actual brands that were doing great, Flamingo Estate, Ocasentials.
she could have been quietly winning, But nope, she wanted all the spotlight and
none of the sweat. You'd think after all the flops, someone in Megan's inner
circle would have told her to slow down, regroup and start small. But instead,
we're watching what looks like a billion dollar fantasy crashing into a wall of
basic business reality. and while all of this is unfolding, She's out here
posting dreamy beach photos and tagging her Instagram stories with vague
promises of a restock later this month. It's like watching someone live in a
Pinterest board while the warehouse burns behind them. the tea, literally and
figuratively, is that even the products themselves don't live up to the hype.
people who actually got their hands on this stuff described it As bland,
forgettable, and weirdly packaged. one person even pointed out spelling mistakes
on the label. for a brand that supposedly wants to rival Goop or even Martha
Stewart's empire, that's rookie level sloppiness. It's like she wanted to skip
the part where you prove yourself, and Jump straight to the part where everyone
calls you a genius, Except no one is. What's wild is how Megan continues to
speak about the brand like it's a movement. on her podcast Confessions of a
Female founder, she made it sound like she was building something
transformative, something soulful. after announcing the brand was on pause, she
was already back on Instagram promising a restock. that whiplash alone says
everything. It's not a strategy. It's confusion in real time. a lifestyle brand
isn't supposed to feel like improv theater. and that brings us to the big
hospitality twist. Apparently, Megan now wants to pivot into hotels, not a
pop-up, not a curated stay experience, full on Meghan Markle branded resorts.
Imagine checking into a place where the logo matches the jam you never got to
try. hospitality is a beast of an industry, especially when you have zero
background in it. most billion dollar hospitality brands took decades to build.
Megan's struggling to Sell HiBiskus t, and now I think she's ready to run a
luxury retreat. That's Delusion served on a silver tray. then, there's the
insider gossip that really pulls back the curtain. source said there's no actual
infrastructure for As ever. no team, no clear vision, just Megan, some
outsourced product picks, and Netflix pulling strings behind the scenes. She's
not developing a brand she's acting in one. and even then, badly, Because when
the people who want to like you start asking what you actually stand for, you've
lost the thread. Pucks report wasn't just a critique, it was a dismantling. They
basically laid out how Megan borrowed her brand logo, offered no innovation, and
dumped poorly planned products into the market just to check a box. and now that
it's flailing, it's suddenly about new directions and future releases. That's
not expansion. That's panic. and don't forget how she fumbled the communication
with her own audience. the people who signed up for her email list didn't even
get a heads up before the launch. by the time the email went out, the products
were already live. who does that? even in the Etsy sellers manage better
coordination than that. It's like Megan forgot the whole point of building a
loyal customer base. the worst part, there's a deeper level of frustration here,
even among her supporters. It's not just that the brand is messy, it's that it
feels lazy, like she thought a few inspirational quotes and some hummingbird
logos would be enough to build an empire. But lifestyle isn't just aesthetics,
it's clarity, it's consistency, and it's trust. three are missing, and now just
when you think it couldn't get any more bizarre, Prince Harry throws his own
plot twist into the mix. According to new reports, he's had serious
conversations about changing his family name to Spencer. yes, ditching Windsor
completely and embracing Diana's legacy, full on. this wasn't just pillow talk
either. he allegedly brought it up with Charles Spencer, Diana's brother and the
logic. he wants to honor his mother's memory while further distancing himself
From the royal institution he spent the last few years torching in public. It's
a move that screams identity crisis. Harry and Meghan have spent years blowing
up bridges, accusing the royal family of racism, leaking personal family details
and documentaries, and painting themselves As misunderstood exiles. But now,
Harry wants to rebrand his As children, Archie and Lillibet As potential working
royals someday, it's like trying to un-cancel yourself after you lit the match,
you can't trash the monarchy, leave the firm, monetize your exit, and then
expect your kids to waltz back into Buckingham Palace when They turn 21 like
it's a summer internship. Sources say Harry wanted their HRH titles added to
their passports and even believes Archie and Lillibet should have the option to

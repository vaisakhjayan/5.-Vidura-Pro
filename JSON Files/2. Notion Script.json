A former bodyguard with deep ties to industry giants, Gene has become a go-to voice for raw, behind-the-scenes truths—especially when it comes to the East Coast–West Coast era and the legends who rose and fell during it.\\n\\nHis latest interview didn’t shy away from controversy, as he openly discussed Suge Knight’s legacy and the fear Suge instilled across the music world. Suge Knight, currently serving time, remains a looming figure in hip-hop history. His name still triggers debate—was he a ruthless businessman or just a man shaped by a ruthless system? According to Gene Deal, it’s both.\\n\\n“You can’t talk about rap without talking about Suge,” he stated bluntly.

Meanwhile, Kevin Hart took a lighter approach to the same topic during a comedy set, playfully roasting the idea of “beef culture” in music.\\n\\n“I ain’t messing with Suge,” Kevin joked. “I get scared when the WiFi glitches, imagine Suge walking in.” The crowd erupted. Elsewhere in the entertainment world, Usher continues to show why he’s earned his icon status. Currently in the middle of a successful tour, Usher recently reflected on his early days in the industry and praised Rihanna for her resilience and artistry.\\n\\n“She’s one of one,” he said. “Rihanna’s not just a performer—she’s a brand, a business, and a vision.” Rihanna, as usual, didn’t have to say a word to make headlines. Her latest Fenty campaign broke the internet again, and fans speculated that a new album may finally be on the horizon.\\n\\nWhile she’s remained tight-lipped, her presence in both fashion and music continues to dominate.\\n\\nTogether, Gene Deal, Suge Knight, Kevin Hart, Usher, and Rihanna each represent a unique slice of entertainment history—some raw, some comedic, some effortlessly cool.\\n\\nBut what ties them together is their influence. Whether through honesty, power, humor, vocals, or visual impact, they each shape the culture in ways that can’t be ignored. And the conversations around them? They’re just getting louder..",

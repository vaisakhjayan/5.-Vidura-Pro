[00:00:00] Benz-Harry and Meghan Markle's story is one of tradition clashing with modernity of
[00:00:05] love-challenging centuries-old institutions and of two individuals seeking freedom under
[00:00:11] a microscope that never blinks.
[00:00:13] Since their wedding in 2018, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have become household names, not
[00:00:19] just for their royal ties, but for the bold choices they've made along the way.
[00:00:24] From the very beginning, Meghan's entrance into the royal family was met with a mix of
[00:00:28] admiration and scrutiny.
[00:00:30] An American actress and humanitarian, she brought a fresh energy to the monarchy, but
[00:00:35] her presence also highlighted the deep undercurrents of British tabloid culture, institutional
[00:00:40] rigidity, and at times racial bias, all of which Meghan and Harry would later speak about
[00:00:45] openly.
[00:00:47] In early 2020, the couple announced their decision to step back from senior royal duties.
[00:00:52] Dubbed Megxit by the media, the move shocked the world and marked a dramatic shift in the
[00:00:57] monarchy's modern era.
[00:00:59] Relocating to California, they began building a new life focused on philanthropy, content
[00:01:05] creation, and raising their children in relative privacy.
[00:01:09] Amid their transition, the royal family faced one of its most somber moments, the death
[00:01:13] of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.
[00:01:17] The passing of Britain's longest reigning monarch not only closed a historic chapter,
[00:01:21] but also brought Harry back into the public royal fold, if only briefly.
[00:01:25] His visible grief, alongside his father King Charles III and brother Prince William, reminded
[00:01:31] the world of the familial bonds still present beneath all the tension.
[00:01:36] Despite criticism and countless headlines, Meghan and Harry continue to forge their own
[00:01:41] path, one that redefines what it means to be royal in the 21st century.
[00:01:47] Their story is still unfolding, but one thing remains clear.
[00:01:51] They're doing it on their own terms.

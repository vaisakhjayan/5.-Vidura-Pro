[00:00:00] Meghan Markle has been one of the most polarizing figures
[00:00:02] in modern celebrity culture.
[00:00:04] From her transition into the British royal family
[00:00:07] to her dramatic departure alongside Prince Harry,
[00:00:10] Meghan's journey has sparked global fascination,
[00:00:13] controversy and commentary
[00:00:14] from some of the world's most influential voices.
[00:00:18] Her interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021
[00:00:20] was a major cultural moment.
[00:00:22] Oprah's calm but pointed questions
[00:00:24] allowed Meghan to share her struggles with royal life,
[00:00:27] sparking debates around mental health, race and monarchy.
[00:00:31] The interview created a ripple effect
[00:00:33] that even reached comedic corners of pop culture.
[00:00:36] One such response came from South Park,
[00:00:38] known for its ruthless satire.
[00:00:41] The animated show aired a parody episode
[00:00:43] that mocked Meghan and Harry's demands for privacy
[00:00:46] while simultaneously pursuing the spotlight,
[00:00:48] amplifying public skepticism
[00:00:50] toward the couple's media strategy.
[00:00:53] In the world of music and cultural icons,
[00:00:55] Beyonce extended a public message of support
[00:00:57] to Meghan after the Oprah interview,
[00:00:59] praising her courage and grace.
[00:01:01] This show of solidarity
[00:01:02] from one of the most powerful women in entertainment
[00:01:05] added credibility to Meghan's narrative.
[00:01:07] On the other end of the spectrum,
[00:01:09] critics like Piers Morgan
[00:01:10] have consistently questioned Meghan's sincerity.
[00:01:14] Morgan famously walked off his own show
[00:01:16] following backlash over his dismissal of her claims
[00:01:18] during the Oprah interview,
[00:01:20] solidifying his role as one of her harshest detractors.
[00:01:23] Meanwhile, figures like Martha Stewart
[00:01:25] have offered a more neutral stance,
[00:01:27] emphasizing the importance of grace under scrutiny,
[00:01:30] without overtly siding with either narrative.
[00:01:33] Even Kevin Hart couldn't resist
[00:01:35] bringing Meghan's situation into his stand-up
[00:01:37] using his platform to joke about
[00:01:38] the absurdity of royal drama in modern times,
[00:01:41] proving that no matter the perspective,
[00:01:44] Meghan Markle remains a cultural lightning rod
[00:01:46] across comedy, media and society at large.

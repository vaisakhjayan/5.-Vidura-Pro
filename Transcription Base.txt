[00:00:00] Alright, let's talk about one of the weirdest, most chaotic royal moments that just refuses
[00:00:04] to die down, Prince Archie's birth.
[00:00:07] Not because of the baby himself, but because of the circus that surrounded his arrival.
[00:00:12] Meghan Markle and Prince Harry managed to turn a royal birth, something that's usually
[00:00:16] handled with precision and tradition, into a confusing mess, full of contradictions, secrecy,
[00:00:22] and what a lot of people now believe was a full-blown cover-up.
[00:00:25] And the more you look into it, the stranger it gets.
[00:00:29] The official story was simple enough.
[00:00:31] Meghan went into labor early in the morning, gave birth, and later that day the palace
[00:00:35] made an announcement.
[00:00:37] But that's just the version we were spoon-fed.
[00:00:40] When you start pulling back the layers, nothing adds up.
[00:00:44] Take the timing, for example.
[00:00:46] Meghan supposedly went into labor in the early hours, yet the palace waited almost 12 hours
[00:00:51] to tell the media.
[00:00:52] Why?
[00:00:53] Even more confusing, by the time they did make the announcement, Meghan had already
[00:00:58] given birth.
[00:00:59] Now, you might think, maybe it was just a private moment for them, no big deal.
[00:01:03] But here's the thing.
[00:01:05] Harry and Meghan's PR team had previously promised to alert the press when she went
[00:01:09] into labor.
[00:01:10] That was their own commitment.
[00:01:12] Then suddenly, silence.
[00:01:14] So when reporters asked about it, the palace gave this carefully-worded statement that
[00:01:17] dodged the real issue and shifted blame onto the media for misinterpreting their timing.
[00:01:22] Classic weasel words.
[00:01:24] It gets worse.
[00:01:26] During the small window between the palace saying Meghan was in labor in the Instagram
[00:01:30] post announcing the baby's birth, journalists asked directly if the baby had already been
[00:01:35] born.
[00:01:36] And palace officials denied it.
[00:01:38] That's not a miscommunication, that's lying.
[00:01:41] And look, people can debate whether Meghan used surrogate, whether she wore a moonbump,
[00:01:45] or whether any of the theories floating around are true.
[00:01:48] But those details, while juicy, aren't even the point.
[00:01:51] The point is that Harry and Meghan lied.
[00:01:54] The palace lied for them.
[00:01:56] And if there's one thing the monarchy isn't supposed to do, it's lie about the basics
[00:02:02] of succession.
[00:02:03] One person who's been banging this drum for years is Dan Wooden.
[00:02:06] Back in 2019, he was an executive editor at The Sun and probably the first mainstream
[00:02:11] journalist to call out how bizarre this whole situation was.
[00:02:14] He actually got Buckingham Palace to answer eight direct questions on the record about
[00:02:19] Archie's birth.
[00:02:19] An almost unheard of move.
[00:02:22] That alone should tell you how rattled they were.
[00:02:25] The palace knew something didn't look right.
[00:02:27] One of Dan's main theories was that the announcement was delayed on purpose to sync up with the
[00:02:31] US morning news cycle.
[00:02:33] He pointed out how the timing of everything lined up perfectly with the 8am New York shows
[00:02:37] like CBS This Morning, where Gale King just so happens to be a friend of Meghan's.
[00:02:43] The palace denied it, of course.
[00:02:45] But when every move seems to benefit the Sussex's American PR game, it's hard not to
[00:02:49] raise an eyebrow.
[00:02:50] And this isn't about attacking Meghan for the sake of it.
[00:02:52] It's about transparency.
[00:02:54] If you're a royal couple, funded by the taxpayers, with a baby in the line of succession, then
[00:03:00] you don't get to cherry pick privacy when it's convenient.
[00:03:03] You can't play the We Want Privacy card while also staging photo shoots and releasing carefully
[00:03:09] curated documentaries.
[00:03:11] This wasn't just bad PR.
[00:03:13] This was a total media disaster.
[00:03:15] And if the goal was to protect their privacy, it backfired spectacularly.
[00:03:20] Because now, nobody trusts the story they told.
[00:03:24] Not the timeline.
[00:03:25] Not the announcements.
[00:03:27] Not even the baby bump.
[00:03:29] And once you lose public trust, especially as a royal, it's almost impossible to get
[00:03:34] it back.
[00:03:35] Meghan's bump became its own storyline.
[00:03:38] The internet noticed it first.
[00:03:40] One day, it looked massive.
[00:03:42] The next day, it was almost flat.
[00:03:44] Videos started circulating where her stomach seemed to fold as she sat down, leading to
[00:03:49] wild speculation.
[00:03:51] Was it a moon bump, a padded prosthetic?
[00:03:53] Theories flooded in, and instead of clearing things up, Harry and Meghan leaned further
[00:03:58] into secrecy.
[00:03:59] That silence added fuel to the fire.
[00:04:02] People weren't just speculating.
[00:04:04] They were becoming convinced something was being hidden.
[00:04:08] Mainstream media didn't want to touch it.
[00:04:13] That's where journalism lost its edge.
[00:04:17] The job isn't to protect people from uncomfortable questions.
[00:04:20] It's to ask them.
[00:04:21] And Meghan's pregnancy had questions stacked from top to bottom.
[00:04:25] Yet big outlets steered clear.
[00:04:27] Only a few, like Dan Wooten, were willing to press the palace.
[00:04:30] And when they did, the answers were robotic, generic, and always avoided the core issue.
[00:04:35] Why the lies?
[00:04:37] One moment stood out.
[00:04:39] The twerking video.
[00:04:40] Meghan was supposedly in labor with baby Lilibet, yet there was a video of her dancing, smiling,
[00:04:46] and looking completely relaxed.
[00:04:48] Released around the same time, it made people do a double take.
[00:04:51] The timeline didn't make sense.
[00:04:53] It made even those who never questioned the first pregnancy start asking, hold on, what
[00:04:58] is going on here?
[00:05:00] Camilla Tominy, a respected associate editor at The Daily Telegraph, wrote about it, but
[00:05:05] never once considered that the bump might be fake.
[00:05:08] When challenged, she responded as if even raising the question was beneath her.
[00:05:13] That's the problem.
[00:05:14] Journalists pretending they're too respectable to explore legitimate inconsistencies.
[00:05:19] If the palace had stuck to tradition and simply told the truth, or even half the truth, none
[00:05:24] of this would have spiraled.
[00:05:26] But once you start lying, every new move looks suspicious.
[00:05:31] Even more bizarre was how the palace handled Harry and Meghan's communication strategy.
[00:05:35] It was chaotic.
[00:05:37] Announcements were delayed, emails supposedly went unsent, timelines didn't match.
[00:05:42] At one point, the palace actually blamed a technical issue for not alerting the press
[00:05:47] on time in 2019, as if phones don't exist.
[00:05:51] It wasn't just a misstep.
[00:05:52] It looked like a clumsy cover-up, and Buckingham Palace, the symbol of order and protocol, suddenly
[00:05:59] looked disorganized and weak.
[00:06:01] And then there's the Instagram post.
[00:06:03] That's how the world officially found out about Archie's birth.
[00:06:07] Not a formal royal statement.
[00:06:10] Not a traditional press conference.
[00:06:12] Just a post on social media.
[00:06:14] And during that brief window, when journalists asked if Meghan had given birth, the palace
[00:06:18] straight up said no.
[00:06:19] They denied it, knowing full well the baby was already born.
[00:06:23] That's the part that crosses the line.
[00:06:26] Because that's not a spin.
[00:06:28] That's just lying.
[00:06:30] Harry and Meghan's team tried to frame everything around privacy.
[00:06:33] But when your child is in line for the throne, privacy stops being just a personal preference.
[00:06:38] It becomes a matter of public trust.
[00:06:40] You're not just a couple, you're an institution.
[00:06:43] You don't get to rewrite royal tradition just because you feel like it.
[00:06:46] And every time they tried, it blew up in their face.
[00:06:49] Worse still, they dragged the palace down with them.
[00:06:52] Buckingham Palace looked like it was following their lead instead of setting the tone.
[00:06:57] And in doing so, it lost credibility.
[00:06:59] The whole situation left royal watchers confused, journalists frustrated, and the public suspicious.
[00:07:05] This wasn't just a media strategy gone wrong.
[00:07:08] It became a symbol of how fractured things had gotten between Harry, Meghan, and the Crown.
[00:07:14] And that's what's so maddening.
[00:07:16] This could have been a moment of celebration, unity, even modernity.
[00:07:20] Instead, it became a masterclass in how not to handle royal communication.
[00:07:24] Questions didn't stop after Archie's birth.
[00:07:27] They kept multiplying.
[00:07:28] One big one was about the photo call at Windsor Castle.
[00:07:32] Harry and Meghan introduced their baby to the world in a controlled, carefully staged moment
[00:07:36] with no outside press, no real spontaneity.
[00:07:40] It was scheduled at 12.40pm UK time, which just so happens to perfectly match the 7.40am broadcast slot on American Morning Shows.
[00:07:51] People noticed, was that just a coincidence?
[00:07:54] Or were the Sussexes more focused on their US media presence than their role within the British monarchy?
[00:08:00] Dan Wooden went straight at this question and asked the palace directly.
[00:08:03] Was the photo call time chosen to sync with American news shows?
[00:08:07] The answer?
[00:08:08] A cold scripted no.
[00:08:10] The time was chosen based on the family's visit to Windsor to introduce Archie to the Queen and Prince Philip.
[00:08:15] But even that didn't line up.
[00:08:17] Why would a royal photo op, one of the most anticipated public moments, get slotted around a private family visit?
[00:08:23] It felt off.
[00:08:25] Like, someone was working backwards from a US media schedule and pretending it was just royal logistics.
[00:08:30] Another mystery?
[00:08:32] Where was Archie actually born?
[00:08:35] Harry spoke about the experience in glowing emotional detail, talking about how amazing Meghan was during labor,
[00:08:42] yet the palace refused to confirm the location of the birth.
[00:08:46] That alone stirred speculation.
[00:08:48] Every royal baby before him had their birthplace confirmed.
[00:08:51] So why hide this?
[00:08:53] If it was just a normal hospital birth, what was there to cover up?
[00:08:57] The refusal to answer made people more curious, not less.
[00:09:01] And then there was the line of succession.
[00:09:03] As the son of Prince Harry, Archie is a direct descendant in the royal line.
[00:09:08] That means legal documentation, proper announcement procedures, and formal acknowledgement from the palace are critical.
[00:09:14] But with this birth, the usual sign-offs were either late, vague, or completely missing.
[00:09:19] Royal birth announcements are typically marked with details like the attending physician, the hospital, and a statement outside the palace.
[00:09:26] None of that happened.
[00:09:27] Instead, we got a delayed press release and a filtered Instagram message.
[00:09:31] To make things more confusing, the palace initially tried to act like nothing was unusual, but the contradictions were piling up.
[00:09:37] One outlet was told Meghan went into labor, another was told she'd already given birth.
[00:09:43] And when reporters pressed for clarity, palace press officers got cagey.
[00:09:48] At one point, they even claimed the announcement was delayed due to an email failure.
[00:09:54] That's the excuse.
[00:09:56] In a palace filled with staff, advisors, and PR pros, they claimed an email didn't go out in time.
[00:10:02] If this had happened once, people might have let it go, but the whole thing was tangled in inconsistency after inconsistency.
[00:10:10] Meghan and Harry wanted to modernize the monarchy, but they ended up introducing chaos.
[00:10:15] They didn't seem to understand, or maybe they didn't care, that when you wear the crowns, wait, you don't get to control the narrative completely.
[00:10:24] And when you try, the backlash can be brutal.
[00:10:28] Their actions didn't just raise eyebrows, they created a vacuum of trust.
[00:10:32] And in that vacuum, theories exploded.
[00:10:35] Some claimed Meghan had used a surrogate, others believed she wore a fake bump.
[00:10:40] More extreme takes said Archie was a borrowed baby, or that he didn't even exist.
[00:10:45] These theories didn't come out of nowhere, they were born from the couple's refusal to communicate clearly, and the palace's unwillingness to demand it.

[00:10:52] This was never about hate, it was about truth, and the truth is still missing.
[00:10:57] What we do know, beyond all the speculation, is that Meghan and Harry lied.
[00:11:02] The palace backed them, and the public was left with a royal mystery that still hasn't been solved.
